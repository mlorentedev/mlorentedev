> Started writing code for image sensors, ended up automating everything around them. Now I focus on self-hosting, deployment reliability, and building tools to make infrastructure less painful.

## Projects

- 🧊 **[kubeLab](https://github.com/mlorentedev/kubelab)** — My over-engineered playground running on Astro, Go, and n8n. Fully monitored because I like graphs.
- ✍️ **[pollex](https://github.com/mlorentedev/pollex)** — My AI editor. Runs Qwen 2.5 on a Jetson Nano because cloud fees are boring. Includes SLOs.
- 🌉 **[ts-bridge](https://github.com/mlorentedev/ts-bridge)** — Forward TCP traffic over Tailscale without needing sudo. Simple and effective.
- 📄 **[pdf-modifier-mcp](https://github.com/mlorentedev/pdf-modifier-mcp)** — Edit PDFs without losing font styles. It's like magic, but with code.
- 📺 **[youtube-toolkit](https://github.com/mlorentedev/youtube-toolkit)** — Downloading transcripts to analyze channels. Data hoarding 101.

<details> <summary>Academic work</summary>

- **[zuidui](https://github.com/zuidui)** — Master's Thesis: Cloud-native microservices on AWS EKS. The full buzzword bingo.
- **[vicon-fpga-face-detection](https://github.com/mlorentedev/vicon-fpga-face-detection)** — Master's Thesis (UMA): image sensor integration on FPGA with PC-based face detection.
- **[emva1288-sensor-characterization](https://github.com/mlorentedev/emva1288-sensor-characterization)** — Bachelor's Thesis (US): Python library for camera sensor characterization.

## What I'm Doing

- **Battling entropy** — Running [cubelab.cloud](https://cubelab.cloud) on my own bare metal clusters.
- **Building tools** — Scratching my own itches with Go. If it annoys me, I write a tool for it.
- **Dumping my brain** — Notes on system design and scaling at [mlorente.dev](https://mlorente.dev) so I don't forget how things work.

## My Philosophy

- **No magic allowed** — I need to understand the underlying layers o-f-e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. If I can't explain it, I don't trust it.
- **Script everything** — If I have to do it twice, it's getting automated.
- **Write it down** — I write ADRs and runbooks so future-me doesn't blame past-me.
- **Own the metal** — Kubernetes on bare metal teaches you things AWS hides.
